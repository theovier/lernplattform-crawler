# Lailaps

**Lailaps** is an application aimed to simplify the download process for documents uploaded to the HSHL learning management system. 
It is completely written in Java and hence usable on different systems.
Its easy to use GUI allows for fast and efficient downloading which would otherwise take several minutes of clicking through course pages.
Also this is my 6th semester software project for the HSHL.

## Getting Started

This section will get you covered when you want to get the application running.

### Prerequisites

You will need at least Java version 1.8 or higher to be installed on your computer.
To check which version you have currently installed type the following in your command prompt

##Miscellaneous

The name **Lailaps** is a reference to the Greek mythological dog.
This dog never failed to catch what she was hunting and this piece of software was also
designed with the thought in mind to never miss a document which is available for download.
